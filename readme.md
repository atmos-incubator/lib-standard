# Lib/Standard

A general-purpose cross-stack JavaScript library.

## Overview

This project serves to codify useful extensions to the JavaScript native API and provide convenient global utility functions for productive application development.

The native JavaScript API is `{ configurable: true, enumerable: true, writable: true }` for very good reasons. It is public and open to experimentation for the betterment of the language.  It ensures the language is resilient to divergent interpreter implementations. And it allows for deciding the shape of that API through a community driven process.  This process provides the necessary feedback loop for the language engineers to make better decisions.

## Documentation

`Lib/Standard` is just getting started so documentation is sparse and sprinkled throughout the codebase. The repo maintains 100% coverage so at the very least you can read notes in the test layer about feature usage.
